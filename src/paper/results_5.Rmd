## Discrepancies in the linear model predict epistatic relationships
![Salt Example](img/HOG_PBS_RESID.png)

### residual profiles cluster into functionally enriched modules:
<!-- (so do the coefficients from before?) -->
*  GO
*  MEME/Scope

### Error modules (groups of error profiles) reveal Known classes of epistatic relationships
<!-- Class 1 -->
The linear model assumes that Kinase identity and Condition identity make independent contributions to gene expression.  

1. If a Condition's effect propagates through a inhibition given Kinase, then the linear model will overestimate gene expression for that Condition-Kinase pair  
    * HSP12 on Salt + PKA (Get GD?)
2. If a Kinase's activity is required to correctly regulate a gene's expression in a condition specific manner, the linear model will badly estimate that condition specific interaction (as there is no term to correct for such a fine tuned response)
