## Introduction

Kinase singalling through the cell is a complex sytem that allows the cell to make informed adaptive transcriptional responses to changes in the external enviroment.

## Experimental Design

## Detecting a Condition specific Kinase Signal

$$ \Delta E_{gck} = C_{gc} + K_{gk} + R_{gck} $$
Where $\Delta E$ is the change in expression for gene $g$, condition $c$, and kinase $k$.
$C$ is the contribution to change in expression due to the condition
$K$ is the contribution to change in expression due to the kinase
and $R$ is the Residual, representing the information that the linear model cannot capture, as well as noise.
