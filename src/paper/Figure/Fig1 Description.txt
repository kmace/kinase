A simple model of gene expression:

For each gene, we model its expression as a simple linear combination of 3 terms:
V, W, and C. we do this by least squares regression.

V represents the effect a particular condition has on gene g
W represents the effect a particular kinase inhibition has on gene g
C represetns the intercept, or the gene level in the control scenario (condition = YPD, strain = Wild Type)

Description of heatmap rows:
each row in the figure corresponds to a single gene

Description of heatmap columns:
For the Expression heatmap - each column represents the gene's expression levels at for a given condition and strain
For the V heatmap - each column represents the contribution that a particular condition has on each gene
for the W heatmap - each column represents the contribution that a particualr kinase inhibition has on each gene
There is only a single column in C, which represents the gene expression level for the base case, where condition = 'YPD' and strain = 'Wild Type', and therefore V = 0, and W = 0
