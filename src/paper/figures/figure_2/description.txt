Decomposition of gene expression matrix:

(A) Per-gene Model decomposition strategy
(B) Model performance over all genes
(C) Full model decomposition. Gene Expression is decomposed into a linear combination of Condition and Kinase Contribution, Residuals include signal that cannot be captured by linear model and noise.

For each gene, we model its expression as a simple linear combination of 3 terms:
C, K, and R. we do this by least squares regression.

C represents the effect a particular condition has on gene g
K represents the effect a particular kinase inhibition has on gene g
R represents the signal that cannot be fit by the linear model. this includes context dependent signal (bais, or deterministic noise), and measurement noise (variance).
