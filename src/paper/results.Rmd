Generating a gene expression heat-map across all samples, we can see that there is definite structure.
The largest structures seem to be defined by Condition, However smaller structures are hinted at on a kinase level.
To explore these further, we use unsupervised methods to cluster the samples.

### Dimensionality reduction on samples reveals distinct condition, kinase, and pathway specific clusters

We collect 300 whole genome gene expression measurements, each with one of 10 conditions, and one of 28 kinases inhibited.
Clustering of these samples through t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) reduces these samples from ~6000 dimensions (genes) into two.
Although this representation can not be used to infer properties of the global structure of the sample space, it can be used to identify clusters of similar samples (gene expression profiles)

```{r ref.label='tsne_cluster', eval=FALSE}
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
select = dplyr::select
tsne_plot = function(df){
ggplot(df,
       aes(x=TSNE1,
           y=TSNE2,
           color = Condition,
           label = Strain_Code)) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  geom_text_repel(size = 2,
                  color = 'black',
                  point.padding = NA,
                  box.padding = unit(0.01, "lines"))
}
```

#### Wild-type samples

Firstly, we will look at the biological replicates in the collected data, 3 or 4 wild-type strains subjected to one of the ten possible conditions.


```{r, message = FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
sample_tsne %>% filter(grepl('WT', Strain_Code)) %>% tsne_plot()# + ggtitle('just WT')
```
We see that the dimensionality reduction maintains information necessary to group WT cells with each other, and separate out conditions.

#### All samples

Now we look at all the data.

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
sample_tsne %>% tsne_plot()
```

We see that samples are generally clustering together based on their condition, or strain.
This indicates that there are strong, reproducible signals generated at the condition and kinase levels.
Clusters also seem to be linked to ther clusters through samples that are part of both clusters.
Interestingly, we also notice that PBS2 and HOG1, do not cluster with other salt samples, but rather cluster together.
We call this a pathway specific cluster.
This may be interpreted as follows: although inhibition of these kinases are not similar in a general sense, the effect of inhibiting these kinases are similar in Salt. Salt is a known activator of the hyper-osmotic stress response pathway, of which PBS2 and HOG1 are its MAPKK and MAPK respectively.

We annotate each cluster below as a condition dominated, kinase dominated, or pathway dominated sample cluster below:

## A strategy to explore Kinome wide signaling under stress

### Intro
Kinases are largely responsible for mediating environmental information to the nucleus where an adaptive transcriptional response can be made.
The propagation of this information occurs through a pathways of cascading phosphorylation events.
Here we use strains with analog sensitive mutants of certain stress associated kinases to block kinase signaling while under a variety of stress.
The resulting change in gene expression is then measured using RNA-seq and analyzed.

From this data we hope to characterize three sets of attributes for each gene:

1. The general effect a condition has on the gene.
2. The general effect the inhibition of a kinase has on the gene.
3. specific instances of condition + kinase-inhibition pairs that interact such that expression cannot be explained by their marginal effects.

### Full model

To achieve this we first construct a mathematical model for the regulation of each gene.

$$ \Delta E_{ij} = C_{i} + K_{j} + I_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij} $$

Where $\Delta E$ is the change in expression for condition $i$, and kinase-inhibition $j$.
$C$ is condition independent contribution to the change in expression in condition $i$.
$K$ is the kinase-inhibition independent contribution to change in expression in kinase-inhibition $j$.
$I$ is the context dependent contribition to the change in gene experssion under condition $i$ and kinase-inhibition $j$.
and $\epsilon$ represents noise due to the measurement.

### Approximation

Since modeling the interaction term $I$ explicitly would take exponentially more samples, and make the problem practically unsolvable (not full rank), we construct an approximation to the full model by only considering the independent terms $C$ and $K$.

which yealds:

$$ \Delta E_{ij} \approx C_{i} + K_{j} $$

Which we model as follows:

We construct a linear model, that takes in two input variables, `Condition` and `Kinase` and applies a ordinary least squares regression to predict the change in `Expression` from the reference state as an output variable (reference state is `Condition = YPD` and `Kinase = None`).
Therefore for each gene, the linear model has the form `Expression ~ Kinase + Condition`.

or

$$ \widehat{\Delta E_{ij}} = C_{i} + K_{j} $$

NOTE: I could just use WT-condition and YPD-kinase here.
It would be easier to explain, however it would also not have the statistical power that we are using with all 300 data points.
especially for the kinase sets.

### Residual

Finally, in order to gain insight into the interaction term $I_{ij}$ that we did not model, we calculate the residual $R_{ij}$:

$$  R_{ij} = \Delta E_{ij} - \widehat{\Delta E_{ij}} = I{ij} + \epsilon_{ij} $$


### Interpretation

The interpretation of the weights in a linear model are as follows.

The intercept indicates the best approximation to the gene expression for wild-type cells in YPD
The Condition weight indicates the best approximation to the change that a non-YPD condition will have on a gene.
(over all kinases)
The Kinase weight indicates the best approximation to the change caused by inhibiting a given kinase (over all conditions)

```{r ref.label='creat_linear_models', eval=FALSE}
```
From these models, we extract weights to address attribute 1 and 2, and residuals for attribute 3.
Investigation of these values follow in downstream analysis.

Model performance is also assessed to see if a simplistic additive linear (with no interaction term) is capable of modeling the majority of the signal.
turns out it does pretty well, see supplement for an in-depth analysis.


## Condition weights identify generally accepted gene expression responses

### Not sure
How am i going to show this? is it important?

lets look at the genes and weights clustered in a heat-map. (this is the vector $K$ for each gene)

It is widely accepted that there are condition specific gene expression responses.
I don't think we have anything new to say here, other than our data also shows this and therefore the gene expression profiles are to be believed.


```{r}
genes %>%
  select(Gene,weights) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  filter(grepl('Condition',term)) -> condition_terms

condition_terms = left_join(condition_terms,t2g)

condition_terms %>%
  filter(p.value<0.01) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=estimate,
             group=term,
             color=term)) +
  geom_density()

condition_terms %>%
  filter(p.value<0.05) %>%
  select(name, term, estimate) %>%
  spread(key = term,
         value = estimate,
         fill = 0) %>%
  remove_rownames() %>%
  column_to_rownames('name') %>%
  as.matrix() -> condition_terms_matrix

  condition_terms_matrix = condition_terms_matrix[apply(condition_terms_matrix,1,max)>0,]
  pheatmap(condition_terms_matrix)

```



## Kinase inhibition indicates kinase activity in reference Condition

### Want to show
Basically.
I want to start to introduce the logic behind kinase inhibition.
If the kinase is off in YPD, we do not expect there to be a significant gene expression response when we inhibit it.
I think one thing we can make a strong claim about is how does a condition modulate a kinase.
we have all the info.
first we start with the basal level here.
then later we use the residual to define context dependent stuff.

This is a heatmap of the $K$ vector for each gene


```{r}
genes %>%
  select(Gene,weights) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  filter(grepl('Strain',term)) -> kinase_terms

kinase_terms = left_join(kinase_terms,t2g)

kinase_terms %>%
  filter(p.value<0.01) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=estimate,
             group=term,
             color=term)) +
  geom_density()

kinase_terms %>%
  filter(p.value<0.01) %>%
  select(name, term, estimate) %>%
  spread(key = term,
         value = estimate,
         fill = 0) %>%
  remove_rownames() %>%
  column_to_rownames('name') %>%
  as.matrix() -> kinase_terms_matrix

kinase_terms_matrix = kinase_terms_matrix[apply(kinase_terms_matrix,1,max)>0,]
  pheatmap(kinase_terms_matrix)

```



## Residual analysis reveals context dependent regulation.

### Motivation

So we know that $R_{ij} = I_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$

If $\epsilon_{ij}$ is small, then $R_{ij} \approx I_{ij}$

If $\epsilon_{ij}$ is large, then we can not use the above formula, however, since experimental noise is unbiased ($\bar{\epsilon_{ij}} \approx 0$), we can get a strong approximation to $I_{ij}$ for a group of similarly regulated genes: 

$\bar{R_{ij}} = \bar{I_{ij}}$ over a set of similarly regulated genes.

We will therefore analyze the residuals of these models to identify context dependent regulation.

Since genes have different variances, we will first normalize the residuals 

### Calculation of standard residuals

When using a linear regression model to account for generalizable effects, residuals identify context dependenet regulation pathways

We identify this for genes (supplement) and expand it to modules (in main text)

We will calculate the standardized residuals for each measurement, where standardized residuals are defined as

$$ S_g = \frac{E_g - \hat{E_g}}{\overline{E_g}} $$

and is by definition normally distributed with zero mean and unit deviation.

```{r ref.label='extract_residuals', eval = FALSE}
```

### Using gene residual size to predict context dependent regulation

We first assume that $\epsilon \approx 0$.

We extract measurements that have the largest residuals, and look at the experimental conditions that produced them.
lets take a look at the top ones:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
'%!in%' <- function(x,y)!('%in%'(x,y))
std_residuals %>%
  arrange(-abs(residual)) %>%
  left_join(t2g %>% select(Gene, name, description, ext_gene)) %>%
  separate(sample_id,c('Strain_Code','Condition'), sep='_') %>% 
  filter(Condition %!in% c('YPD','SDC') &
         !grepl('WT',Strain_Code) &
         stringr::str_length(ext_gene)!=0) -> hypotheses


#knitr::kable(hypotheses[1:15,], caption = 'The most significant residuals')

genes %>%
 select(name, weights) %>%
 unnest() %>%
 select(name, term, estimate, p.value) %>%
 filter(grepl(pattern = 'Strain', term)) %>%
 mutate(term = str_replace(term,"^[A-Z][a-z]*",'')) -> strain_weights

genes %>%
 select(name, weights) %>%
 unnest() %>%
 select(name, term, estimate, p.value) %>%
 filter(grepl(pattern = 'Condition', term)) %>%
 mutate(term = str_replace(term,"^[A-Z][a-z]*",'')) -> condition_weights

hypotheses %>%
 group_by(Condition, Strain_Code) %>%
 mutate(norm_res = residual/sd(residual)) %>%
 ungroup() %>%
 rename(Strain = Strain_Code) %>%
 left_join(strain_weights, by = c('name' = 'name', 'Strain' = 'term')) %>%
 left_join(condition_weights, by = c('name' = 'name', 'Condition' = 'term'), suffix=c('_Strain', '_Condition')) %>%
 select(name, residual, norm_res, Condition, Strain, ends_with('Condition'), ends_with('Strain')) %>%
 mutate_at(vars(starts_with('p')), funs(-log10(.))) %>%
 arrange(-abs(norm_res)) -> gene_info

gene_info %>%
 #select(-residual) %>% 
 #filter(p.value_Condition>2, p.value_Strain>2) %>% 
 top_n(20, norm_res) %>%  knitr::kable()



```

Looking at these residuals, sorted by magnitute, we see that specific gene-condition-kinase groups have large residuals. The largest of these results is the expression of FUS1 in Salt with PBS2 inhibited. This can be interpreted as follows. The expression levels of FUS1 regularly increase by 1.5 in Salt, and decrease by 1.5 when PBS2 is inhibited. however its expression when both Salt and PBS2 as very different from their expecited individual contributions. In fact the expression is 9 times larger than expected. This ultimately means that the expression of FUS1 depends strongly on a process that includes the direct or indirect interaciton between Salt Stress and PBS2 activity. In this particualr instance, it is known that PBS2 is required to repress the mating pathway under hyperosmotic stress. since both pathways share the MAP3 kinase STE11

This table is available as a supplemental table saved here:

```{r}
write.csv(gene_info, file = '../../output/gene_info.csv')
```






### Using module residual size to predict context dependent regulation

In the case where $\epsilon \not\approx 0)$ we can stil assume that the mean of $\epsilon \approx 0$ 

first show that there is structure in residual

```{r}
library(pheatmap)
pheatmap(std_resid_matrix, color=coolwarm_hcl, scale='none', breaks = res_breaks, show_rownames = F, annotation_col = tibble(cname = colnames(std_resid_matrix)) %>% separate(cname,c('Kinase','Condition'),'_') %>% transmute_all(funs(as.factor)), show_colnames = F)
```


#### Defining modules

Here we build up residual patterns from a single gene to a module.

#### Diving into an example

As an example, we are going to look into the mating pathway.
The mating pathway shares a kinase with the HOG pathway (STE11).
It is known that mating pathway genes are not expressed during salt stress, and that their repression is due to the activity of the HOG pathway.

We see this phenomenon in our data:


```{r}
hypotheses %>%
  filter(name == 'FUS1') %>%
  select(Strain_Code, Condition, residual) %>%
  group_by(Strain_Code, Condition) %>%
  summarise_all(mean) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Strain_Code, y= Condition, fill = residual)) + geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient2(low = ('cyan'), mid = 'black', high = 'yellow') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ggtitle('FUS1')

hypotheses %>%
  filter(name == 'AGA1') %>%
  select(Strain_Code, Condition, residual) %>%
  group_by(Strain_Code, Condition) %>%
  summarise_all(mean) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Strain_Code, y= Condition, fill = residual)) + geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient2(low = ('cyan'), mid = 'black', high = 'yellow') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ggtitle('AGA1')

```


Although we do not have replicates of these residuals, we can become more confident in our prediction if we see a similar pattern in the whole mating pathway.

To define a pathway, we use INSPIRE to cluster genes using other datatsets.

These clusters were actually generated from orthogonal data (gasch, and pronk datasets)
NB: for this data I actually also include my data...
need to fix

I happen to know that FUS1 cluster is cluster 36 in this dataset, which I hope will exhibit the same residual pattern (activated in Salt, when PBS2, or HOG1 are inactive)

```{r, eval=F}
clusters_inspire = read.csv('../../input/clusters/INSPIRE_clusters/all_clusters.csv')
want = clusters_inspire %>% filter(Cluster==36) %>% select(Gene)
hypotheses %>%
  filter(Gene %in% want$Gene) %>%
  select(Strain_Code, Condition, residual) %>%
  group_by(Strain_Code, Condition) %>%
  summarise_all(mean) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Strain_Code, y= Condition, fill = residual)) + geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient2(low = ('cyan'), mid = 'black', high = 'yellow') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

```

And it does.
Although we do not have replicates for FUS1, if we average the residuals for the __module__ where FUS1 was included we get a robust residual pattern.


#### proving that modules are in fact modules 

In order to account for noise in measurements, we further cluster genes wit similar context depedent regulation into modules.
Hoping to show that these modules have Enrichment for GO Terms, and TF motifs in their promoters.

Lets see if there are meaningful go terms and motifs for this cluster:

```{r}
#knitr::kable(this_cluster)
# webshot::webshot("../../intermediate/INSPIRE_clusters/cluster_36/ame.html")
```

And what about GO terms?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
get_go_terms_from_list = function(query_list, background_list) {
    library(goseq)
    library(org.Sc.sgd.db)
    genes = numeric(length(background_list))
    names(genes) = background_list
    genes[query_list] = 1
    pwf = nullp(genes,"sacCer2","ensGene")
    GO.wall=goseq(pwf,gene2cat=as.list(org.Sc.sgdGO2ALLORFS))
    return(GO.wall)
}

print_out_terms = function(g_dir){
  library(knitr)
  g_dir %>%
    dplyr::mutate(pval = min(over_represented_pvalue, under_represented_pvalue),
                  percent_in = numDEInCat / numInCat) %>%
    dplyr::arrange(pval) %>%
    dplyr::filter(pval<0.001) %>%
    dplyr::select(term, pval, percent_in) %>%
    arrange(-percent_in, pval) %>%
    head() %>% kable()
}

g = get_go_terms_from_list(clusters_inspire %>% filter(Cluster == 36) %>% pull(Gene),
                       t2g$Gene)
print_out_terms(g)
```

## Pbs2 is independently required for activation of (a submodule of) the ESR under stress.

### Claim 1: PBS2 is required for proper activation of GSR

#### Other Evidence
RNA-seq Evidence: Lower GSR (PC1) Expression in stress with PBS2 strain

```{r}
ggplot(sample_tsne, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Strain_Code=='PBS2')) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Condition)
```

#### Idea:
Measure ESR activity while removing PBS2

#### Experiment:
MSN2 Localization in YPD, and glucose dropout with and without PBS2
HSP12 Expression in YPD, and Glucose dropout with and without PBS2

#### Expect to see:
Activity go down with PBS2 delete

### Claim 2: PBS2 acts at, or upstream of PKA

#### Idea:
If upstream: Direct modulation of PKA activity should rescue the PBS2 phenotype.

#### Experiment:
MSN2 Localization with direct PKA inhibition with and without PBS2
HSP12 Expression with direct PKA inhibition with and without PBS2

#### Expect to see:
Direct PKA inhibition to produce same levels of activity, regardless of PBS2 state

#### Results:
![](img/hsp12_basal_nmpp1_gd.jpg)

### Claim 3: PBS2 acts at or above RAS

#### Idea:
Does direct modulation of RAS activity rescue the PBS2 phenotype? If so, the effect of PBS2 must be upstream of, or at the level of RAS.
If not, PBS2 must act somewhere downstream of RAS.

#### Experiment:
Measure HSP12 activity with RAS held in the active (PKA on, MSN2 cytoplasmic, HSP12 off) followed by PBS2 activation

#### Expect to see:
MSN2 becomes less nuclear (more cytoplasmic) after PBS2 is inactivated.
(This requires that the PBS2-as has normal function in the absence of 1-NMPP1)

#### Result:

![](img/salt_exp.jpg)

### Claim 4: PBS2 has a secondary function to Hog1

#### Idea:
PBS2 has a role that is HOG1 independent.
this is motivated by differences in gene expression:

```{r}
sample_tsne %>% mutate(strain_of_interest = ifelse(Strain_Code %in% c('HOG1', 'PBS2'), Strain_Code, 'Other')) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = strain_of_interest)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Condition)
```


#### Experiment:
Measure HSP12 activity with a dose response of PKA-as inactivation  with either WT, $\Delta$PBS2, or $\Delta$HOG1

#### Expect to see:
PBS2 to have a differnet effect to HOG1, which should look more like WT.

#### Result:
