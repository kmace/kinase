## A strategy to explore Kinome wide signaling under stress

### General Overview:

Kinases are largely responsicble for mediating information from the environment to the nucleous where decisions are made. Here we use analog sensisitive mutatants of kinases involved in dynamic regualtion of stress response pathways to probe the kinase's activity and contribution during stresses. 

### Strategy

28 Stress assocated kinases were selected and from the analog sensitive kinase library (reference Joanna's paper). These strains, along with 4 reference wild type strains were then grown overnight to log phase. Once in log phase, kinase activity was inhibited using an inhibitor, and one of 10 conditions was then applied. Gene expression was then measured 20 min later by rna-seq.

#### Analysis Pipeline:

![](img/Kinase_Pipeline.png)

### Data Loading and Normalization:

Data is aligned with STAR, and then expression levels are normalized using DESeq's variance stabilizing transformation. It is then loaded in for analysis. (see the [supplement](#Supplement) specifically [here](## Sequence Alignment, Normalization, and Transformation:) for how its done)


```{r ref.label= 'data_loading', eval=FALSE}
```

### Calculation of statistics, and filtering:

We then calculate basic statistics on the gene expression data:

```{r ref.label='gene_statistics', eval=FALSE}
```

Genes with no variability will be problematic in downstream analysis. As we can infer very little about these genes, it is appropriate to filter them out. We will arbitrarily filter out genes that have a dynamic range is less than 1 in all the samples. as well as genes that have a low level of counts (Mean expression < 2^6 == 64 Counts)

```{r ref.label='gene_filter', eval=FALSE}
```

### Clustering of samples shows distinct kinases, and condition, and epistatic groups

#### Clustering with TSNE

There are 300 samples, each with an applied condition, kinase inhibition, and a gene expression vector. Here, we cluster the samples by performing t-SNE on gene expression vectors with default t-SNE parameters

```{r ref.label='tsne_cluster', eval=FALSE}
```


When plotting the gene expression vectors in t-SNE space, we see that the samples cluster into distinct kinase, and condition, and context dependent clusters:

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
library(ggrepel)
select = dplyr::select
tsne_plot = function(df){
ggplot(df,
       aes(x=TSNE1, 
           y=TSNE2, 
           color = Condition, 
           label = Strain_Code)) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  geom_text_repel(size = 2,
                  color = 'black',
                  point.padding = NA,
                  box.padding = unit(0.01, "lines"))
}
tsne_plot(sample_tsne %>% filter(grepl('WT', Strain_Code))) + ggtitle('just WT')
tsne_plot(sample_tsne)
```

#### Full dataset heatmap

Using these groups, we order the samples in terms of their cluster, and show the full heatmap.

TODO: Define tsne clusters, and then show the clusters in a morpheous image

### Calculation of standard residuals

When using a linear regression model to account for generalizable effects, residuals identify context dependenet regulation pathways

We identify this for genes (supplement) and expand it to modules (in main text)

We will calculate the standardized residuals for each measurement, where standardized residuals are defined as

$$ S_g = \frac{E_g - \hat{E_g}}{\overline{E_g}} $$

```{r ref.label='extract_residuals', eval = FALSE}
```

Now that we have the standardized residuals, lets take a look at them. What structure do they have? lets take a deep dive.

First question, what is the spread of these standardized residuals, according to theory, they should look similar to a z-score, meaning that they are normally distributed. lets check:

```{r}
resids = std_residuals %>% filter(residual_type == 'Full') %>% pull(residual) 
hist(resids, breaks = 200)
```

Okay, that looks good, but what are the mean and variance? we expect 0, and 1.

```{r}
print(paste('Mean:', mean(resids)))
print(paste('Standard Deviation:', sd(resids)))

```

Close enough!

### Using residual size to predict epistasis

We extract measurements that have the largest residuals, and look at the experimental conditions that produced them. lets take a look at the top ones:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
std_residuals %>%
  filter(residual_type == 'Full') %>% 
  arrange(-abs(residual)) %>% 
  select(-residual_type) %>% 
  left_join(t2g %>% select(Gene, name, description)) %>%
  separate(sample_id,c('Condition','Strain'), sep='_') -> hypotheses

knitr::kable(hypotheses[1:15,], caption = 'The most significant residuals')
```

This table is available as a supplemental table saved here:

```{r}
write.csv(hypotheses, file = 'hypotheses.csv')
```

Next, lets see what `Condition + Strain` pairs contain significant residuals over all genes in the ESR:

```{r}
hypotheses %>% 
  filter(abs(residual) > 3) %>% 
  filter(Gene %in% c(scan('../../input/genes_of_interest_and_gene_sets/ESR/repressed_ESR.txt', what = character()),
                     scan('../../input/genes_of_interest_and_gene_sets/ESR/activated_ESR.txt', what = character()))) %>%
  select(Condition, Strain) %>% 
  table() %>%
  `+`(1) %>%
  log() %>%
  heatmap(col=viridis::viridis(20))

```

#### Some quick observations here:
* Kinases in the same pathway cluster together:
    + SLT2 and PKC are very closely clustered!
    + PBS2 and HOG1 are very closely clustered!
* SCH9 Seems to have an effect, but only in YPD?

#### Diving into a some examples

Okay, so if the findings above are true, we should see that the residuals between PBS2, and HOG1 to correlate for genes that have significant residuals. lets check that now:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
p = hypotheses %>% 
    filter(abs(residual) > 3) %>% 
    filter(Strain %in% c('HOG1', 'PBS2')) %>% 
  select(name, residual, Strain, Condition) %>% 
  spread(Strain, residual) %>% 
  mutate_at(3:4, function(x) if_else(is.na(x),0,x)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=HOG1,y=PBS2,fill=Condition,color = Condition, text= paste(name, Condition, sep='_'))) + geom_point() 
plotly::ggplotly(p, width = 880)
```

Interestingly, inactivation of PBS2, and HOG1 do not always produce the correlated residuals. They do for Salt, but do not for Menadione, and Glucose Dropout. This might be evidence that PBS2 and HOG1 have different functions in non-salt conditions. 



#### Expanding single gene analysis to gene modules

Here we build up residual patterns from a single gene to a module.

As an example, we are going to look into the mating pathway. The mating pathway shares a kinase with the HOG pathway (STE11). It is known that mating pathway genes are not expressed during salt stress, and that their repression is due to the activity of the HOG pathway.

We see this phenomenon in our data:


```{r}
hypotheses %>% 
  filter(name == 'FUS1') %>% 
  select(Strain, Condition, residual) %>% 
  group_by(Strain, Condition) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Strain, y= Condition, fill = residual)) + geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient2(low = ('cyan'), mid = 'black', high = 'yellow') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ggtitle('FUS1')

hypotheses %>% 
  filter(name == 'AGA1') %>% 
  select(Strain, Condition, residual) %>% 
  group_by(Strain, Condition) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Strain, y= Condition, fill = residual)) + geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient2(low = ('cyan'), mid = 'black', high = 'yellow') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ggtitle('AGA1')

```


Although we do not have replicates of these residuals, we can become more confident in our prediction if we see a similar pattern in the whole mating pathway. 

To define a pathway, we use INSPIRE to cluster genes using other datatsets.

These clusters were actually generated from orthogonal data (gasch, and pronk datasets)
NB: for this data I actually also include my data... need to fix

I happen to know that FUS1 cluster is cluster 36 in this dataset, which I hope will exhibit the same residual pattern (activated in Salt, when PBS2, or HOG1 are inactive)

```{r}
clusters_inspire = read.csv('../../input/clusters/INSPIRE_clusters/all_clusters.csv')
want = clusters_inspire %>% filter(Cluster==36) %>% select(Gene)
hypotheses %>% 
  filter(Gene %in% want$Gene) %>% 
  select(Strain, Condition, residual) %>% 
  group_by(Strain, Condition) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Strain, y= Condition, fill = residual)) + geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient2(low = ('cyan'), mid = 'black', high = 'yellow') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

```

And it does. Although we do not have replicates for FUS1, if we average the residuals for the __module__ where FUS1 was included we get a robust residual pattern.


Lets see if there are meaningful go terms and motifs for this cluster:

```{r}
#knitr::kable(this_cluster)
webshot::webshot("../../intermediate/INSPIRE_clusters/cluster_36/ame.html")
```

And what about GO terms?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
get_go_terms_from_list = function(query_list, background_list) {
    library(goseq)
    library(org.Sc.sgd.db)
    genes = numeric(length(background_list))
    names(genes) = background_list
    genes[query_list] = 1
    pwf = nullp(genes,"sacCer2","ensGene")
    GO.wall=goseq(pwf,gene2cat=as.list(org.Sc.sgdGO2ALLORFS))
    return(GO.wall)
}

print_out_terms = function(g_dir){
  library(knitr)
  g_dir %>%
    dplyr::mutate(pval = min(over_represented_pvalue, under_represented_pvalue),
                  percent_in = numDEInCat / numInCat) %>%
    dplyr::arrange(pval) %>%
    dplyr::filter(pval<0.001) %>% 
    dplyr::select(term, pval, percent_in) %>% 
    arrange(-percent_in, pval) %>%
    head() %>% kable()
}

g = get_go_terms_from_list(clusters_inspire %>% filter(Cluster == 36) %>% pull(Gene),
                       t2g$Gene)
print_out_terms(g)
```

## Pbs2 is independently required for activation of (a submodule of) the ESR under stress.

### Claim 1: PBS2 is required for proper activation of GSR

#### Other Evidence
RNA-seq Evidence: Lower GSR (PC1) Expression in stress with PBS2 strain

```{r}
ggplot(sample_tsne, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Strain=='PBS2')) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Condition) 
```

#### Idea:
Measure ESR activity while removing PBS2

#### Experiment:
MSN2 Localization in YPD, and glucose dropout with and without PBS2
HSP12 Expression in YPD, and Glucose dropout with and without PBS2

#### Expect to see:
Activity go down with PBS2 delete

### Claim 2: PBS2 acts at, or upstream of PKA

#### Idea:
If upstream: Direct modulation of PKA activity should rescue the PBS2 phenotype.

#### Experiment:
MSN2 Localization with direct PKA inhibition with and without PBS2
HSP12 Expression with direct PKA inhibition with and without PBS2

#### Expect to see:
Direct PKA inhibition to produce same levels of activity, regardless of PBS2 state

#### Results:
![](img/hsp12_basal_nmpp1_gd.jpg)

### Claim 3: PBS2 acts at or above RAS

#### Idea:
Does direct modulation of RAS activity rescue the PBS2 phenotype? If so, the effect of PBS2 must be upstream of, or at the level of RAS. If not, PBS2 must act somewhere downstream of RAS.

#### Experiment:
Measure HSP12 activity with RAS held in the active (PKA on, MSN2 cytoplasmic, HSP12 off) followed by PBS2 activation

#### Expect to see:
MSN2 becomes less nuclear (more cytoplasmic) after PBS2 is inactivated. (This requires that the PBS2-as has normal function in the absence of 1-NMPP1)

#### Result:

![](img/salt_exp.jpg)

### Claim 4: PBS2 has a secondary function to Hog1

#### Idea:
PBS2 has a role that is HOG1 independent. this is motivated by differences in gene expression:

```{r}
sample_tsne %>% mutate(strain_of_interest = ifelse(Strain %in% c('HOG1', 'PBS2'), Strain, 'Other')) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = strain_of_interest)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Condition) 
```


#### Experiment:
Measure HSP12 activity with a dose response of PKA-as inactivation  with either WT, $\Delta$PBS2, or $\Delta$HOG1

#### Expect to see:
PBS2 to have a differnet effect to HOG1, which should look more like WT.

#### Result:
