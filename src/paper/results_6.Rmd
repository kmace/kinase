## Pbs2 is independently required for activation of (a submodule of) the ESR under stress.

### Claim 1: PBS2 is required for proper activation of GSR

#### Other Evidence
RNA-seq Evidence: Lower GSR (PC1) Expression in stress with PBS2 strain

```{r}
ggplot(sample_tsne, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Strain=='PBS2')) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Condition) 
```

#### Idea:
Measure ESR activity while removing PBS2

#### Experiment:
MSN2 Localization in YPD, and glucose dropout with and without PBS2
HSP12 Expression in YPD, and Glucose dropout with and without PBS2

#### Expect to see:
Activity go down with PBS2 delete

### Claim 2: PBS2 acts at, or upstream of PKA

#### Idea:
If upstream: Direct modulation of PKA activity should rescue the PBS2 phenotype.

#### Experiment:
MSN2 Localization with direct PKA inhibition with and without PBS2
HSP12 Expression with direct PKA inhibition with and without PBS2

#### Expect to see:
Direct PKA inhibition to produce same levels of activity, regardless of PBS2 state

#### Results:

### Claim 3: PBS2 acts at or above RAS

#### Idea:
Does direct modulation of RAS activity rescue the PBS2 phenotype? If so, the effect of PBS2 must be upstream of, or at the level of RAS. If not, PBS2 must act somewhere downstream of RAS.

#### Experiment:
Measure HSP12 activity with RAS held in the active (PKA on, MSN2 cytoplasmic, HSP12 off) followed by PBS2 activation

#### Expect to see:
MSN2 becomes less nuclear (more cytoplasmic) after PBS2 is inactivated. (This requires that the PBS2-as has normal function in the absence of 1-NMPP1)

#### Result:

### Claim 4: PBS2 has a secondary function to Hog1

#### Idea:
PBS2 has a role that is HOG1 independent. this is motivated by differences in gene expression:

```{r}
sample_tsne %>% mutate(strain_of_interest = ifelse(Strain %in% c('HOG1', 'PBS2'), Strain, 'Other')) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = strain_of_interest)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Condition) 
```


#### Experiment:
Measure HSP12 activity with a dose response of PKA-as inactivation  with either WT, $\Delta$PBS2, or $\Delta$HOG1

#### Expect to see:
PBS2 to have a differnet effect to HOG1, which should look more like WT.
