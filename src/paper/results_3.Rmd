## Condition and Strain identities explain non-redundant aspects of the gene expression
Since a kinase inhibition is a much more targeted puruturbation compared to a stress, we should ask how much information is in each contribution. 

To break this down, lets see how much $R^2$ we loose by removing a variable from the model:

$$ R^2_{loss} = R^2_{full} - R^2_{reduced} $$

```{r ref.label='relative_importance', eval=FALSE}
```


```{r}
gather(as_tibble(lasts), Last_Factor, added_r2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = added_r2, fill = Last_Factor)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .5) + 
  ggtitle('R^2 loss from removing variable', subtitle = 'Each variables contribution when included in the model last, also sometimes called usefulness')
```
