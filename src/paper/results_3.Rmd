## Condition and Strain identities explain non-redundant aspects of the gene expression

To break this down, lets see how much $R^2$ we loose by removing a variable from the model:

```{r ref.label='relative_importance'}
```


```{r}

# How much aditional R2 would I get by adding in a random assignment of factor size 10, or 30?


gather(as_tibble(lasts), Last_Factor, added_r2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = added_r2, fill = Last_Factor)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .5) + 
  ggtitle('Additional R^2 from adding factor last', subtitle = 'Each variables contribution when included in the model last, also sometimes called usefulness')
```



What does strains give you, that conditions dont?
