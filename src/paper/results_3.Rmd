## Condition and Strain identities explain non-redundant aspects of the gene expression

To break this down, lets see how much $R^2$ we loose by removing a variable from the model:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(relaimpo)
getri = function(mod){
r = calc.relimp(mod, type = 'last')@last
return(r)
}

load('../../input/images/model_parameters.RData')

out = lapply(genes$Full_model, getri)
lasts = do.call(rbind, out)
#colnames(lasts) = c('Strain', 'Condition')
#pdf('')

# How much aditional R2 would I get by adding in a random assignment of factor size 10, or 30?


gather(as_tibble(lasts), Last_Factor, added_r2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = added_r2, fill = Last_Factor)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .5) + 
  ggtitle('Additional R^2 from adding factor last', subtitle = 'Each variables contribution when included in the model last, also sometimes called usefulness')
```
