From David:

It's so reassuring to see that the high expression outliers make sense. E.g., RNR3 and TSA2 have menadione as an outlier; KAR2 has tunicamycin as outlier; AGA1 has salt as an outlier in the hog1 and pbs2 strains (and in snf1 – more new biology!). And beautifully, RPL18 and RPL20A have YPD as an outlier.

It also looks like HUG1 is under negative control by Hog1 and positive control by Pbs2 – this may be another window into a new way of thinking about the HOG pathway. Also, there are 0 papers on pubmed that mention both HUG1 and Hog1...

Two quick things: you have DBP2 in there twice, and KDX1 is the same as the "MLP1" reporter that Andres used to study the CWI pathway. (So keep KDX1 and get rid of the MLP1 you have because it actually has nothing to do with CWI.)

Also, what do you think is going on with ACT1 in response to AZC? Bizarre.

Looking forward to skyping on Thursday!

Best,
D

From Andres:

It’s cool that Kdx1 and Prm5 look very similar and they look different from Gsc2. That’s what I saw when inducing with drugs and overexpressing Msn2.
I also tried the promoter for YLR042C, it reports cell wall but not through Slt2, just curious if you get some intuition on what controls it from your data J

And a couple other observations from my data: Sdp1 goes up with Msn2-5a overexpression. Sed1 would turn on with both Msn2-5a and zymolyase.
