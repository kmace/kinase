#Notes for Morpheus analysis

## Stress Specific analysis

### Tunicamycin

Genes that are on in Tunicamycin, but are down in IRE1:
Manual = man_selelcted
based on matrix method = down_reg_genes
Its clear that IRE1 is the major Kinase associated with Tunicamycin.

### Heatshock:

Upregulated Heatshock genes seem to be down in the following strains:
1. Tor2
2. Pho85
3. Ygk3

One thing to notice is that Tor2 was a slower grower, so it may need some additional analysis to see if the genes are generally down.

When looking at the 32 Genes specified by pincus: It seems that the most different Kinase samples are:

1. Tor2
2. Sch9
3. Ygk3

One other thing to note is that menadione seems to look a lot like heatshock generally. with heatshock genes being more highly expressed in that condition than in heatshock itself.

see menadione analyis for whatever other insight is there.

One thing I see as well, is if we use SSA1 as a source, and then find genes that are similar, (see close_to_ssa1_in_HS.txt) they are all heatshock related genes.
