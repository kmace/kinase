# Cellular Noise Regulons Underlie Fluctuations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

## A Strategy for Measuring Covariance in Protein Expression Using a Single Fluorescent Protein

## Intrinsic Noise Scales with Protein Expression Level, Whereas Extrinsic Noise Shows a More Complex Pattern

## Promoters of High Extrinsic Noise Proteins Are Enriched for Specific Transcription Factor Binding Sites

## Genes Regulated by Msn2/4 Show Correlated Steady-State Fluctuations

## Correlations Induced by Steady-State Fluctuations Are Predictive of Dynamic Response to Stimulus

## Noise in MSN2/4 General Stress Pathway is Predictive of Survival in Stress Conditions

## Multiple Noise Regulons Containing a Coherent Set of Genes Exist in S. Cerevisiae

## Genetic analysis traces noise in regulons to PKA and TOR pathways
