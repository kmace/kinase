# Figure Layout:

## Figure 1:
### Purpose:
The intention of the first figure is to do the following:
* Introduce the reader to the data
* Explain how Analog sensitive Kinases work
* Explain the scientific method (Stress + Drug, on strain, then RNAs-seq)
* Give the user a sense for the vast size of the dataset

### Panels:
1. A cartoon of stress induced kinase signaling leading to activation of a transcriptional program. Also the use of an ATP analog that specifically blocks the activity of a kinase.
2. A heatmap or other method showing all the data
3. Principal Components of the data?



## Figure 2:
Validation of known biology
* Can we show that kinases regulate known target genes
* Can we show that kinases regulate known transcription factors and transcriptional programs
* Can we show that stresses activate known target genes
* can we show that stresses activate known transcription factors and transcriptional programs



## Figure 3 and 4:
* Kinase centric analysis
* Maybe Kinase to TF hypothesized connectivity graph?
* What genes are target of a given kinase?
	* what conditions are required for this to occur?
* Can we back calculate the TF from the gene?

## Figure 5:
Potential new hypotheses

Compile a list of new biology for others to potentially go after
1. Hog1 activity represses Hug1 - a reporter for DNA damage
2. AZC up-regulates the levels of Act1 (Actin)
3. Pbs2 activity is requried to repress the Ribosome biogenesis pathways under stress.

## Figure 6:
Validation of a vignette

# Figure Methods:

## Single gene analysis
* Heatmap/Barplot Plots

## Single Kinase analysis
* Volcano Plots
* Scope and MEME

## Single Stress analysis
* Morpheous and others

# Notes
One thing that I've been thinking about, is that I will be using the same methods to show known biology, as well as show new biology. therefore, isn't it a better idea to go with a methods based approach and follow a generic structure of showing the known biology and then hypothesizing on new biology each time?
